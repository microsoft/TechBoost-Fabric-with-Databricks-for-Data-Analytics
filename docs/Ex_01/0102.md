### Task 1.2: Create/Build a Lakehouse
Now, let's see how each department in Contoso could easily create a Lakehouse in their workspace without any provisioning needed by simply providing the name, given the proper access rights of course!

1. Click on the **left bottom icon** and click on **Data Engineering**.

3. Enter the name by clicking on +++**lakehouseBronze**+++.

4. Click the **Create** button.

5. Repeat **steps 1 through 5** to create two more lakehouses with the following names by clicking on +++**lakehouseSilver**+++ and +++**lakehouseGold**+++ respectively.

	>**Note:** For this lab we need three lakehouses altogether.

6. Click on **Workspaces** in the left navigation pane and select **ContosoSales@lab.LabInstance.Id**

We are now ready to start data ingestion. As the above names suggest, we will showcase the Medallion architecture. This means we will ingest the raw data in the bronze layer first from disparate sources for Contoso. After that, the data will be curated and enriched to the silver and then gold layers.
